# Kentico.ConsoleApp

This is a starting point for making a console app that interfaces with Kentico. Useful for integrations, migrations, data exploration, etc...

## Setup

Copy appsettings.example.json to appsettings.json and set your connection string and other CMS variables.

Within the csproj, set your dependencies. Also set the version of the Kentico Libraries to match your CMS version.
